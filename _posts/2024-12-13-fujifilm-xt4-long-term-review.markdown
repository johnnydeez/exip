I've owned and used the Fujifilm X-T4 for almost four years now. And, while it certainly isn't the perfect camera, I think it is as relevant today as it was when it was released in 2020.

For this review, please do not expect a laundry list of technical specifications. You can find that in hundreds of other places. I will be focusing on what it has been like to use and own this camera over the last few years, as well as addressing whether or not you should consider purchasing one.

All images in this article were taken with the X-T4 and edited by me in either Lightroom or Capture One.

### Image Quality
The big dark secret that almost no one seems to mention when it comes to image quality with digital cameras is this: virtually any professional or prosumer digital camera made in the last 7 years is going to provide you with extremely high-quality images. I have a large, 24-inch print on my wall from a 12-megapixel Panasonic camera I bought 8 years ago, and it looks fantastic. So, if you are concerned about the 26-megapixel sensor in the X-T4 not being sufficient for you, please don't stress about it. I take photos with it and commonly crop them down by 30% to 40% while still walking away with high-resolution (or high enough) images.

What matters much more are color and dynamic range. Both of which, I am happy to say, are more than adequate with the X-T4. Of course, the camera includes Fujifilm's fantastic colors.

And, while I love the Fuji colors, I can't say I like them that much more than Canon or Nikon files. I think this aspect of Fuji's cameras might be a touch overhyped. But, don't get me wrong. The colors are great, and having Fuji's custom color profiles available for post-processing in my edits is extremely handy and saves a lot of time. This is especially true for editing portraits where appealing skin tones are important. Being able to start my edit with the Astia profile and then work from there just saves me a lot of effort. 

Beyond that, I would say that in general, the X-T4 was a significant step up from the Fujifilm X-T2 I was shooting with before. I can't tell you exactly why, but I distinctly remember opening the first files I shot with the X-T4 and having that 'wow' moment. The files were truly impressive. Not that the X-T2 was bad by any means, great camera. But the X-T4 took things to another level.

### Build and Ergonomics
My next opinion will probably be a bit controversial. I don't expect many people to agree with me.

First, I find all of Fuji cameras to be a bit lackluster when it comes to build quality. Sure, they feel ok in the hand and I've never had one break down on me. But, for me, they lack a certain robustness and premium feel that I enjoyed with my Nikon cameras. It's an unfair comparison in a way, because Nikon is probably best-in-class in the build/feel department. I've never owned a Leica. But, there it is.

The Fuji X series cameras are well made. But command dials feel plastic-like and unsatisfying to click. The buttons everywhere on the camera are just... fine. And, while I commend them for the quality and feel of the top dials (shutter, exposure comp, iso), everything else just kind of lets the camera down a bit. Now, I much prefer Fuji's cameras over the Panasonic cameras I have owned in terms of look and feel. But, I still can't give Fujifilm 5 out of 5 stars here.

The ergonomics of the X-T4 feel decent. The grip is larger than some of the other X cameras and I am a happy flip screen user. Of course, the top dials are lovely to use and make operating the camera enjoyable. They also allow you to see all of your settings while the camera is off. So, I can shoot with this camera all day and then some, leaving it off most of the time and still being able to see my settings or update them. 
It's not as comfortable as literally any other camera with a deeper grip, but for its form factor, I feel it is a reasonable compromise.

### Autofocus
Nothing to write home about here in the autofocus department. With single point AF-S (which is what I shoot in 90% of the time) everything is good. Focus the camera, re-frame the shot, take the shot. Works great. Very fast and very reliable.

Face tracking and eye tracking? Well... it depends.

Putting the camera into AF-C (continuous) mode and enabling face and eye detection yield mixed results. 

In low light, it can be particularly untrustworthy. In good light, I will often get a 70% or more keeper rate. It's something I use, but not something I depend on, if that makes sense.

One thing I will say is that changing the AF-C Custom Settings to number 2 (Ignore Obstacles) helps a bit. The biggest game changer was when someone on the internet recommended I change the Release/Focus Priority setting from 'Release' (the default) to 'Focus'. This turned the X-T4 into a completely different camera when it came to autofocus tracking. So, I do recommend that.

Anyway, all that to say if you're taking portraits for fun or of friends and you want to use the autofocus tracking, it works decent. If you're depending on it for professional wedding work or something... yeah, I'm not so sure. People do it. And, I'm not a wedding photographer. But, I'm not sure I'd depend on it.

### Should You Buy It?
And now for the big question. The question you are probably here to answer. Should you buy one?

Honestly, yes. I've been very happy with my Fujifilm X-T4 and it has served me reliably. Delivering high quality images with no complaints. 
I shoot landscapes, urban environments, night photos and travel photography. And for me, it has been a fantastic companion. It's small enough to enjoy carrying around and 'professional' enough to justify using it over my cell phone. What has kept me with Fujifilm for the last 6 years is the versatility of their APS-C X system. It's not the biggest sensor, but the lenses are pretty small. It's not the cheapest system but it's also not eye-watering expensive. It's not the best image quality you can get, but it's very good. It's not the lightest camera, but it's far from heavy. You can't get the shallow depth of field, but you can get a shallower depth of field than on a micro-four-thirds camera.

For me, Fuji just checks most of the boxes. It's an easy camera to take around the world and for the most part, it stays out of my way and lets me take the photos I enjoy. Which, after all, is what it's all about.
