Did you know that’s an urban legend. JFK never said that. Well, he said he was a Berliner, but that was indeed the correct way of putting it. I guess it was quite a few years later that the story ran suggesting he had called himself a donut. Which he did not actually do.

This is not really in any way relevant, except that I am in Berlin. Which has been a fascinating experience.

Initially, I booked a flight here because I was on the way to Turkey, and there were no direct flights to Istanbul. When I travel, I very much prefer direct flights. It’s just too exhausting to be switching planes and countries all day (not to mention the COVID trickery). So, if I can’t find one, I just add the intermediary city to the trip. 

One week in Berlin turned into two. Two weeks turned into: I’m going home. Ha ha ha.

Not for any specific reason really. I like it here. But I woke up a few mornings ago, made an espresso, sat down to look out my hotel window and just realized I was done. Booked a flight back to Chicago shortly after that; I have four more days here.

This trip has been remarkable, and exactly what I needed. The fact that I have the luxury of spending a month in Iceland, then a few weeks in Germany (at my leisure) is not lost on me—trust me.

However, I’ve made some pretty major lifestyle choices about home, and I’m ready to put those into action.

In terms of photography, I’ve shot quite a bit here. I have a whole other photo post I will do, but wanted to update you all on the current situation. Let me say though, that photography here is very challenging, Berlin is so eclectic. Every scene has a kind of insane mix of bicycles, classical and modern architecture, and graffiti. In addition, there are lots of rules about when people can and cannot be in your photos. Which I find a bit absurd. It’s been very difficult environment for me, but probably a good creative exercise.

Anyway, more on that later. Hope you all are well.
