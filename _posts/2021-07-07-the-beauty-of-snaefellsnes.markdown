After spending about ten times more days in Reykjavik than every other traveler I met, like them, I eventually got a car and hit the road. First stop was Snæfellsnes Peninsula (pronounced SNA-FULL-SNESS, I guess. You don’t want to be learning Icelandic pronunciation from me).

I was told by the internet that this region was like an entire mini-Iceland. That turned out to be true,

The tragedy of this country, however, is that the roads are extremely narrow and only one lane each way. There are also very few turn-outs. The photos here are about one tenth of the ones I would have liked to take. I don’t really feel like I captured this place to its potential. But, I had three days. Did what I could.

Finally, my new jam seems to be turning my camera sideways, placing a subject in the center-ish of the frame, and putting the camera low to the ground. Almost all of these shots were taken that way. This is either a sign of progress or regression. Jury is still out.
