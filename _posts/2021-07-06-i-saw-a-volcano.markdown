I am proud to have seen my first volcano, and though I thought before I went that I would try and put together some kind of cinematic and epic footage of the whole thing, I realized very quickly that wasn’t really realistic. And, if I’m honest, I am a little tired of that kind of content. The internet is full of people who have somehow managed to make every day life and tourist filled mountains look like Michael Bay films.

The truth is, if you go here. You will be joined by hundreds of other people in puffy jackets getting blown around on the rocks while you all try and enjoy what little you can see of the eruption. That’s the deal. So, that’s what’s in the video.
