Even though I’ve been editing my images in Lightroom for forever, I decided to start playing around with my Fujifilm camera’s jpeg output. I have to say, I kinda get why people rave about this now; the colors and tonality are really awesome.

This one actually happens to be a custom recipe from the <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2020/05/27/my-fujifilm-x100v-kodachrome-64-film-simulation-recipe/">Fujifilm Weekly blog (Kodachrome 64)</a>

It was kinda nice not to have to do any processing after taking it. Not every images comes out of the camera looking great, but that probably has as much to do with my skills and preferences as anything else.
