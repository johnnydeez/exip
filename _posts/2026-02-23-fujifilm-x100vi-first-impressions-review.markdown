A first impressions review.

In 2022, the Fujifilm X100V exploded on social media and became almost impossible to buy. This timing was extraordinarily unfortunate for me, as I was about to buy one at that time. I am largely absent from social media, so the TikTok buzz was not a motivator for me (which I am proud of). But I watched Fujifilm's press event when they released the camera, and it was on my list after I saved some money. Sadly, when the funds became available, the camera was not.

Fast forward four years, and I found myself in Tokyo, Japan during the summer of 2025. A quick Reddit search revealed a shop that MIGHT have some in stock just a one-hour train ride from my hotel. On the off chance I might actually be able to buy one at retail pricing… off I went. I didn't call first because my Japanese is painful and my loathing of phone calls even more so.

Fujiya Camera in Nakano was my destination, and upon my arrival—don't you know—they had not only multiple used X100V cameras, but also the new X100VI cameras below retail pricing.

I almost threw my credit card at the nice Japanese gentleman.

But $1,450 USD is no small sum. Was it worth it?

**Short version:** Good camera. But at this price, it is impractical for anyone who isn't a professional or avid enthusiast.

All images except for this first one in Japan were taken with the x100vi.

### Traveling With The X100VI

This was partially a purchase for a trip to Italy I was going on with my girlfriend a few months later. I hemmed and hawed over what camera and lens to bring to the land of wine and cappuccino. It wasn't a photo trip, so I didn't want to burden myself with lots of gear. The XT4 is just a little heavy for all-day carry; I was a little bored with it at that moment anyway. So, the X100 was the perfect selection, and if you're not doing a photography-focused trip, it truly is a fantastic travel companion.

Slinging the X100VI over your shoulder for a day of sight-seeing is a breeze. Most of the time, I didn't even notice I had it with me as it floated on the strap at my back or hip. And the amount of photographic quality and technology packed into a camera that small and inconspicuous is truly a tremendous way to travel. I have taken more than one camera to more than one corner of the world, and I have to say this was my favorite way to capture a city. It is perfect in an urban environment. However, it is not without its limitations. I will get to that.

### Classic Fujifilm + Build Quality

Honestly, there is not much to comment on regarding the physical camera itself. All classic Fuji X. The dials feel nice. The physical controls are a delight. The lens is nothing I would write home about, but it's no slouch—just a good performer. The colors look like all the other Fuji colors. Everything is as you would expect, except for the very flimsy-feeling doors, covers, and seals.

This is a disturbing trend I have noticed with their cameras over the last three or so years, and one that deeply concerns me. In truth, the camera feels of decent quality in the hands. But I have had a repair issue with my XH2 and am seeing more and more people on YouTube and forums complaining of a significant drop in quality. For what this camera costs, there is really no good excuse, in my opinion. However, the parts that you actually interact with frequently are metal, feel solid, and are confidence-inspiring. I even bashed the thing against my girlfriend's camera when I picked her up to put her on a wall. However, there was no damage. So… perhaps it is quite sturdy and my concerns are unwarranted.

### It Really Is a Special Camera - Optical Viewfinder - ND filter

And now to the best two parts of the X100 cameras: the optical viewfinder and the built-in ND filter.

Why this is, to my knowledge, the ONLY mass-produced camera with a dual optical/evf viewfinder is beyond my comprehension. It's just the best way to shoot. I would put this feature in every camera I own if I could. I can't tell you how many reviewers passed over this aspect in their reviews, noting that it was interesting but not worth using. What on Earth?

First, the EVF kinda sucks. Feels very low-res compared to my XT4 and XH2. It works, but not something I would seek out.

The optical viewfinder puts you back in the moment and place you are. The refresh rate is infinite, because it's just reality. The view is wider than your capture, so you can see what is outside your frame. It's crisp. It's clear. It has just enough information displayed, but not too much.

And, while there were certainly times that I switched to the EVF just to be sure I was getting the right exposure, I would say 60% of my shooting was with the optical viewfinder. It took me right back to my happy DSLR days. When moving quickly to capture important shots, it might not be the best, but for a slow photo walk that benefits from immersion, the optical viewfinder is a dream.

And the second-best part of the camera? The built-in neutral density filter.

I hate filters. And I hate tripods. I just hate hassles, and that's exactly what filters and tripods create. But with one flip of a switch, I can apply the ND filter and shoot wide open in daylight without sending my shutter speed to the moon. This has tremendous advantages for video, but I used it for photos on occasion too. It's the kind of thing you probably already know you will appreciate if you indeed… will appreciate it. Otherwise, you can safely ignore this feature.

### Other Notable Features

I won't dwell on the sensor or megapixels for long because, honestly, it's the absolute least important part of any modern camera. The 40MP is great—not mind-blowing, but good. It resolves a lot of detail in good light. Handy for cropping, but not that much more detailed than the 24MP sensor. The IBIS is a great feature and nice to have in any camera. I appreciate it for video and also for low-light shooting. The images overall look fantastic, and the reason I haven't spent much time talking about it is that they look exactly like any other Fuji camera with this sensor and processor combo. It's thoroughly modern with great colors and great rendition. If you like Fuji files, you will like these.

### Downsides

It's not a perfect camera. I mentioned already that the doors covering the battery and audio jacks feel like they belong on a toy.

It comes with a fixed 23mm lens which, while very practical, is too wide for my taste.

And the menus are just, well, Fujifilm menus. So, not amazing. I am used to it now, having owned the cameras for six years. But I think Nikon and Canon shine in this department. Fujifilm really needs to just start over from a UI perspective. I get that it's a challenge given the inputs and volume of information that has to be displayed. But, yeah, not great.

Also, changing from photo to video mode requires you to go into the drive menu and then scroll through the menu to change it. This is an absurd workflow on any camera in this day and age. If you insist on setting it up that way, please at least allow me to assign a toggle for photo/video to a custom button somewhere. You made a tiny travel camera with an ND filter and 6K, 10-bit recording and then made it a pain to switch to video. I could understand this decision as a first attempt. But the X-E3 was like this too, from years ago. It's not a good UX choice.

And lastly, the price.

$1,500 is not an outrageous price to ask for what you are getting. It is a one-of-a-kind camera. It is also, however, a lot of money... especailly for a camera that is essentially an enthusiast camera. That amount of money will buy you not only a lot of cameras from other brands like Lumix or Sony, but $1500 will also buy great new and used cameras from Fujifilm that allow for lens changing, various controls, and designs that might suit you better, etc.

### Conclusion

The Fujifilm X100VI, while imperfect, is one of my favorite cameras of all time. I hope it serves me for many years to come, and I am sure it will be a faithful coffee shop and casual travel companion for hundreds of trips and outings in the future.

The real question, if you don't own one, is whether or not the price is justified. If $1500 is a lot of money to you (it is to me) and you are a casual photographer, I would pass.

If you can afford it and photography is an obsession, go for it.
