Well, this is it. What I feel like was my best photo from Iceland.

I had a plan to post a whole series here, but as I looked over everything, I kinda decided I wasn’t really that happy with most of them. The other good ones were from the peninsula, which I already posted. 

I find this incredibly ironic, because Iceland is so photogenic. Too much so, even. I’m going to attribute this somewhat dismal result to the following:

Iceland’s roads are tiny and kind of dangerous. There is no shoulder, anywhere. It’s not safe (or legal, I think) to stop on the side of the road. So, I had to drive by a lot of otherwise amazing opportunities. 

I’m also kind of burnt out on landscape photography. That’s really all I shot in California for a number of years. So, as much as I was enjoying the scenery, (and truly, it’s stunning; you have to come here) I didn’t feel that compelled to collect more pictures of rocks and mountains.

Well, I guess I have two photos of some houses I liked. I will leave you with those, so… there are three photos in this post. It was all a lie. 

This weekend, I’m off to Berlin. We’ll see what transpires there and how long that lasts. Feeling in a bit of a funk this week, kinda sad for some reason. Hopefully it’s just the cloudy weather. 

I try to remember when I travel that there are a lot of extreme ups and downs. Definitely more so than ‘normal’ life (whatever that is).
