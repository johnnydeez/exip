I had no idea how many waterfalls there were here in Iceland. So, if you’re into that kinda thing, this is your place.

I felt compelled to take a lot of video of them, so I decided to put a little compilation together. Hopefully it’s relaxing and chill. 

This place was exactly what I needed after a year of lockdown. What a gift it has been to be able to travel again. There are annoying moments, for sure. For example, there are no public laundry services in this country? WTF is that about? Also, shopping here is just like the 90s. You just wander around asking people where stuff is until you eventually find it. (No Amazon).

But aside from those minor inconveniences, this place has been purely epic, and the people have been lovely.
