Well, I have been back in the U.S. for about a week now. Finally got some time to go over all of the images I shot in Berlin. So, I figured it was time for a post.

Not much to say except that Berlin is a visual mess for someone like me. I tend to gravitate towards a lot of simplicity and subject isolation in my photos. That was very difficult to achieve there. Consequently, I felt like I had to adapt my style a bit. 

In a way, this happens anywhere you go with a camera. Every city, person and landscape presents different challenges. 

Berlin just has a lot going on, pretty much everywhere you look. 

In the end, I got a few images that I am happy with, but nothing that ranks among my subjective best. I had a very pleasant time regardless, and appreciated the creative challenge. 

Headed to Colorado Springs this week to check out an RV, then finally back to LA. Hope you all are well.
