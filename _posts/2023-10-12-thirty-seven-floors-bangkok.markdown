I've written this post a half-dozen times.

I just don't really know where to start orâ€”how to. My time in Thailand was unlike any other travel experience I've had.

Detailing it here feels like it would somehow cheapen the experience. So, instead, I'll keep things brief..

I sat 37 floors above Bangkok, watching a storm roll in over The Bay of Thailand.

    </a>
</div>

I burnt off a decade of stress at the edge of a sun-soaked pool.

I said goodbye to someone.

I learned a lot about myself. About my life.

It was the kind of thing they put in books. The kind of story one doesn't imagine ever makes its way into real life.

I will be forever grateful for my time here.
