The above, I think, was my highlight in Iceland. 

Itâ€™s funny how as you research places you intend to go in a new country, you have no idea which items will be under or overwhelming. 

This is just a short walk along the coast from Arnarstapi to a Cafe. I happened to go in the reverse direction, because the light was better. But if you ever make your way over to this area I highly recommend you pay it a visit. Finally, wait until evening to take the stroll. When I first got there, there were loads of tour buses and and the afternoon light was really flat and intense; it would not have been a pleasant walk.

In the evening though, the light coming off the mountains, rocks, and ocean are simply stunning. I lucked out and got some pretty good weather for Iceland.

The entire experience was immensely relaxing.
